### What is Screenshow?

Screenshow is a macOS-only screen recording tool that helps you present your product and workflows with studio polish. Record your screen, then automatically elevate it with cinematic zooms, motion-graphic panning, and a clean background so your content takes center stage.

### Key Features

- **macOS-first performance**: Built specifically for macOS for a smooth recording and editing experience.
- **One-click capture**: Record your full screen, a specific window, or a custom region.
- **Automatic background wallpaper**: Replace visual clutter with a tasteful background for a clean, on-brand look.
- **Smart Zoom**: Guide attention with smooth zoom-ins/outs on important interface elements.
- **Motion-graphic Panning**: Add dynamic camera moves that follow the action without manual keyframing.
- **Fast export**: Produce shareable demo videos with minimal steps.

### Installation

1. Download the latest build from [Screenshow.app](https://Screenshow.app).
2. Open the downloaded file and drag Screenshow into your `Applications` folder.
3. On first launch, grant required permissions in macOS when prompted:
   - `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording`
   - Optional: `System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone`

### Quick Start

1. Launch Screenshow.
2. Choose a capture mode: Full Screen, Window, or Region.
3. Enable microphone or system audio if needed.
4. Click `Record` to start, then `Stop` when finished.
5. In the editor, apply:
   - **Zoom** to spotlight important UI areas.
   - **Motion Pan** to smoothly follow interactions.
   - **Background Wallpaper** to remove desktop clutter automatically.
6. Export your polished demo and share it.

### Editing Essentials

- **Zoom**: Add focus points to animate zoom-in/zoom-out and direct attention to key moments.
- **Motion-graphic Panning**: Create smooth camera moves across your recording—no manual keyframes required.
- **Background Wallpaper**: Automatically fills and styles the canvas around your captured content for a clean, consistent frame.

### Permissions Required

- **Screen Recording**: Needed to capture your screen.
- **Microphone** (optional): Needed only if you record voice-over.

### Troubleshooting

- **Black or empty recordings**: Ensure Screenshow is enabled under `Screen Recording` permissions.
- **No microphone audio**: Verify the Microphone permission is granted and input levels are correct.
- **Choppy playback**: Close resource-heavy apps and ensure sufficient disk space for recordings.
